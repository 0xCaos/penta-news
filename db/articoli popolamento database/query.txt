Just how many players are actually behind this wild success though?', 'At certain times since release, Fortnite has had a pretty impressive player base. A lot of people wonder about the exact size of the Fortnite player count. It seems like the game is incredibly popular, although there’s often a feeling that it is past its peak. \nMost game developers rarely release this kind of information. There is an exception to this though, every now again Epic release some very specific data on the Fortnite player base. This is typically when the player base or active players reaches some kind of all-time high. We can figure out a bit of a bigger picture of the player count from this data and some other sources. While it is sometimes decreasing, the Fortnite player count in 2021 is still impressive.\n HOW MANY PEOPLE PLAY FORTNITE?\nEpic Games doesn’t give entirely frequent or accurate pictures of how many people play Fortnite. We do have some metrics and measurements though for how many active players Fortnite has.\nThe first is the total amount of active accounts. We know that Fortnite had over 125 million players within a year of its release.  It also seems that the total number of registered numbers is up to 350 million registered users. That is around 4% of the world’s population. Something about that fact probably doesn’t seem right though, does it? That’s because registered users are a pretty bad measure of the Fortnite player count.\nThe total registered users is just the total number of accounts created. This is by no means one per person. Lots of people have access to more than one Fortnite account, created accidentally or sometimes on purpose. On top of, if you’re wondering is Fortnite loosing players then this is a factor too. Registered accounts aren’t necessarily in use.\nEven among big figures in Fortnite like the best Fortnite streamers or the top Fortnite pro players, have operated quite a few accounts under their own name. It might be against the rules, but that rule-breaking can be pretty brazenly flouted. Some players even start up a new account frequently to have a quick match with a lobby full of bots to practice. So registered users aren’t a particularly helpful measure of how many people are actually playing.\nIn terms of how many are actually active and playing, there were 12.5 million playing concurrently in 2019. Fortnite’s best ever month for player count was in 2018, when 78 million were actively playing in August. Additionally, back in December 2020, over 15.3 million players united to beat Galactus in a single-day event.', '2021-05-14 00:00:00', 'fortnite-player-count-number-of-players.jpg', 10, 'Rick Yesta');

After all, it’s more than just crowning the highest damage weapons as the best snipers on warzone. Various factors can come into play, such as effective range, scope control and even bullet velocity, per se.\nAX-50 – THE BIG DADDY\nAs its nickname suggests, the AX-50 lives up to its name as a deadly sniper rifle in the right hands. A headshot from this bad boy can guarantee a confirmed kill, putting the enemy forces at a massive disadvantage.\nCoupled with its decent mobility, it’s not as punishing as the other options on the list for the high damage output. Ideally, you would want to be using the AX-50 at mid-range clashes, where it’s most effective. Although it does suffer from inaccurate aim down sights, this can be conveniently improved with attachments such as a Stippled Grip Tape, Tac Laser, and Singuard Arms Assassin.\nThe sniper role may often be synonymous with camping solo, but the AX-50 is built for more aggressive scenarios. Another reliable yet neglected alternative to mid-range combat is the SPR-208, which only a handful of seasoned players consider a deadlier Warzone sniper rifle.\nHDR – THE CLASSIC AWP\nFor the traditional sniper players, the HDR brings the nostalgic feel of what sniper rifles should deliver. A devastating shot at a very long distance is achievable with the HDR since it has one of the most extended ranges.\nWhile longer range leads to poor damage drop-off, the Monolithic Suppressor and 26.9” HDR Pro barrel attachments provide desirable countermeasures. Furthermore, using the higher-calibre FMJ bullets will provide improved bullet penetration, leaving no safe spots for enemies.\nYet, all these perks come at only the cost of mobility, so some map awareness will come in handy. Knowing when the enemy is approaching close and navigating a new viewpoint will be critical for sneaky long-ranged shooters.\nKAR98K – IF SNIPERS WERE MELEE WEAPONS\nPerhaps standing still during the entire match isn’t your cup of tea, and you had rather be bumping into foes at every corner. Then, the KAR98K is your go-to for its quick scoping tactics.\nThe KAR98K recently received buffs, where it can effectively deliver confirmed headshot kills. This makes it quite literally a pocket sniper rifle, which you can use aggressively. Considering its close-range benefits, KAR98K’s damage drop-off is not negligible, so the Monolithic Suppressor will offer some decent range.\nNonetheless, it’s still a sniper rifle that relies on one’s good aim, which is to consistently blow the enemy’s head. Aiming anywhere else, protected by armor, will not only result in an unfatal shot but provide enemies some breathing room to flunk you out.\nZRG 20MM – THE SNIPER MINIGUN\nThere’s definitely no denying that the vast majority of COD player base loves close-range combat. Hence, another good close-range alternative is the ZRG 20MM, notably for featuring the highest bullet velocity.\nAlongside its minimal bullet drop, we have ourselves a trendy pick among veteran COD players and newcomers alike. After all, bullet drop mechanics is presumably complicated to master and requires longer scoping periods.\nIf COD Warzone had taught us anything, it’s to rush into enemy frontlines without hesitation, so we highly recommend the ZRG 20MM for starters.\nPELINGTON 703 – YET ANOTHER ‘MELEE’ SNIPER\nLastly, the Pelington 703 serves as a solid alternative to the KAR98K for aggressive adversaries. It utilizes fast scoping, which with some practice, can work like clockwork at consistently sending out shots.\nAs aforementioned, you should play around corners and close combat so that you get the perks from using the Pelington 703 for such scenarios. Now that we depicted the Pelington 703 as a quick loading rifle, the best attachments would be the 27.2” Combat Recon and Infiltrator Grip, which improves bullet speed and overall movement speed, making you a speed demon in the match.\nWe briefed about the best sniper Warzone has to offer, it’s time to put them to the test. Do note that while these may be popular picks among COD players, there are still a vast array of weapons. So really, whatever secures you the most headshots would be your best snipers in Warzone to pick up.', '2021-07-27 00:00:00', 'Warzone-Sniper,jpg', 15, 'Rick Yesta');

	'HUYA DOTA2 INVITATIONAL 2021 FINALS PREDICTION AND MATCH ANALYSIS', 
	'It’s been an incredible showing of Dota 2 talents at the Huya Dota2 Invitational. However, with one last day to go, 
	things are looking blurry about which candidate will win.', 
	'Southeast Asia representative, OB.Neon surprised everybody with unexpected victories over the Chinese rivals. Notably, 
	they defeated team Royal Never Give Up and the famed Invictus Gaming to secure their position as grand finalists. \n
	On the contrary, OB.Neon is at the brim of elimination in the Dota Pro Circuit 2021-22 (DPC2021-22) SEA region. Hence, we 
	were reasonably baffled by OB.Neon’s unexpectedly great run at the Huya Dota2 Invitational 2021.\n 
	INVICTUS GAMING VS ROYAL NEVER GIVE UP (LOWER BRACKET FINAL)\n
	With OB.Neon’s newfound victory over IG, the fans are divided even further on which Chinese powerhouse to side. On one hand, 
	IG is the Singapore Major champ and maintained a dominating form even in the International 10 (TI10). There’s no denying that 
	IG is arguably the most synchronized team in the market, as they have great team morale.\n
	Whereas RNG rose to our expectations as a hot candidate to debut at the DPC2021-22. Housing several former PSG.LGD players and 
	other high-profile players, RNG’s current line-up looked significantly better than the trainwreck, Team Elephant. On paper, 
	both teams are formidable, so their match odds of approximately x1.85 odds reflects that.\n
	MATCH PICKS, BANS & STRATEGIES\n
	While the general odds are relatively even, there are exotic betting markets that may look enticing. Before that, let’s talk 
	drafts and strategies.\n
	IG heavily relies on big team fight combos, which is an understatement since IG excels in initiations into clean teamwipes. 
	Their midlaner, Zhou “Emo” Yi is essentially IG’s sole playmaker, alongside both supports providing counter initiations and 
	saving mechanisms. We will certainly see Void Spirit or Ember Spirit picks for Emo, but that’s assuming their opponent isn’t 
	already opting for heavy lockdowns.\n
	We saw OB.Neon effectively forced Emo to play outside his typical hero pool. This compromise was arguably what led to IG’s 
	downfall during the earlier upper bracket final. Hence, expect multiple long-range saving supports, such as Weaver and Abaddon.\n
	Meanwhile, RNG opts for aggressive playstyles that often snowball well into the midgame. It’s a standard playstyle, that would 
	work most of the time if their opponent wasn’t an elusive player. Against IG however, team RNG will most certainly need to 
	re-evaluate their plans. Nevertheless, expect Lu “Somnus丶M” Yao to play his signature picks, mostly aggressive carries, 
	such as Bloodseeker, Leshrac, or Broodmother if he’s feeling adventurous.\n
	These heroes will force IG’s reaction as it would be impossible to ignore Somnus asserting dominance over the enemy territory.\n
	MATCH PREDICTIONS AND ODDS\n
	Reviewing their playstyles, it’s evident that these teams love their teamfights, which of course means massacre. Albeit we will have 
	to side RNG on this match even though IG is the more seasoned team.\n
	The death counter can increase drastically as the game progresses due to IG’s aggression. Total kills can reach well over 55.5 
	kills, which gives a decent x3.12 return. Another consideration is the match duration, which seems to average at over 40.5 
	minutes, rewarding x3.32 returns.\n
	Special markets, such as “First Blood, Destroy First Tower, Kill First Courier and Win Map” can be a fun bet since it returns 
	x7.00 winnings. RNG is a good candidate for this particular bet since their aggressive draft calls for easy first blood, 
	quicker pushing capabilities, and win the map. There’s no doubt that it’s indeed a difficult task, but considering its multi-fold 
	returns, it’s worth the leap of faith.\n
	Consider the “First Blood and Win Map” market in favor of RNG too. At a decent x3.06 return, it’s an easier alternative to the 
	previous market and has a higher chance of occurrence. These odds make for a great betting slip together and are exclusively 
	available on GG.bet.\n
	OB.NEON VS ROYAL NEVER GIVE UP – GRAND FINAL (UPDATED)\n
	OB.Neon could pull off a win at the Huya Dota2 Invitational 2021, if they best RNG in their drawn out games. While OB.Neon have 
	proven their strength by taking down both RNG and IG before, it still easy to win a best of series versus any Chinese team.\n
	The grand final is an excruciating best-of-five series, so there’s certainly less room for mere flukes. Expect more then 4 games 
	for sure in these series, and average game times longer then 30 minutes.',

	'CSGO MOVES & RUMORS BEFORE THE NEW YEAR – MAJOR ROSTER SHUFFLES COMING', 
	'Ahhh, the post-CSGO Major roster shuffle. What a time. Those who failed to achieve victory are questioning themselves and if 
	their team is capable of greatness. Some choose to maintain their course with the players they have now, some choose to make 
	changes. This year, there were a lot of confirmed changes amongst top teams.', 
	'There are many still rumored yet to be confirmed. Amongst the most interesting rosters that are changing is Team Liquid. The 
	once powerhouse North American team has fallen to new lows with their current roster. A massive shuffle is needed and that’s 
	exactly what they are doing.\n
	THE CONFIRMED\n
	Liquid has confirmed a few big changes so far. They have officially announced the removal of FalleN, Stewie2K and Grim from 
	their starting lineups. Two of the three rumored signings have proven to be true. oSee, who got his big break on HenryG’s 
	Cloud9 roster, has now signed with TL. oSee has been showing good numbers in tier 2 playing on Extra salt, and has impressed 
	his peers in online ladder play. He will fill the role of AWPer, which TL has had a hard time filling with this past roster 
	with players passing the role back and forth.\n
	The other big Liquid signing is shox. Though he has performed on an average level the last little while, he could be a good fit 
	for a support role à-la xyp9x, with his icy veins under pressure in the clutch. He is still one of the best players in the world 
	on LAN in 1vX situations. Since he is 29, he has been in every situation imaginable and has the tendency to make great plays. If 
	this is his last run on a tier 1 team, this is a good role for him to have. He may no longer have what it takes to be a star 
	player, but he has the knowledge and experience to contribute. This is the natural progression of a star CSGO player.\n
	Over in Europe, Torbjørn “mithR” Nyborg departed MOUZ for a coaching gig at Apeks. Unicorns of Love, sAw and Into 
	the Breach all released their rosters, with everyone seeking to re-build at the start of the year.\n
	THE SPECULATION\n
	Recently, 100 Thieves announced that they would be transferring nitr0 to an unknown team. After more than a year out of the game, 
	he will be likely returning to CSGO and potentially TL? EliGE continues to speak highly of him, saying he wants Nitro as his IGL. 
	Nitro was on Team Liquid during their peak when they won the Grand Slam back in 2019. TL would have been the best team in the 
	world if it hadn’t been for the greatest team of all time, Astralis. I’m sure somewhere in the back of his mind Nitro thinks he 
	can get the team back to the heights at which they once were.\n
	Meanwhile, MOUZ is looking at OG’s Valdemar Bjørn Vangså for their roster into the upcoming season. Astralis is rumored to be 
	looking at Heroic talent for their roster revamp. Plenty of teams are holding the cards close to their chest, and more “leaks” 
	should arrive in the second week of January.\n
	Until then, happy new year and brace for a hectic CSGO offseason.',
