            <h1>About us...</h1>
            <h3>Who are we?</h3>
            <p>The development team is composed of four graduate students at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Padova</span> University: <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Matteo Casonato, Matteo Midena, Davide Milan</span> and <span lang="sr" xml:lang="sr">Danilo StojkoviÄ‡.</span> The site you're currently on was made as a project for the Web Technologies course.</p>
            <h3>What is it about?</h3>
            <p>Our main goal is to present the latest news concerning the world of <span>electronic sports</span>, videogames played competitevely by professional players. This side of videogames is something we're pretty passionate about so we decided to cover it on this website.</p>
            <h3>What are our core values?</h3>
            <p>The main principle and the concept that inspired the name is the five Ws (Penta is greek for five); they each represent one question in the English language: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Who</li>
                <li>What</li>
                <li>When</li>
                <li>Where</li>
                <li>Why</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are the questions each one of our editors needs to answer while writing an article.</p>
            <h3>Who can write for us?</h3>
            <p>Just about anyone, all you need to do is <a href="../signup.php">Sign up</a> and create an account on the website, then you can send us a "become-a-writer" request via email which we will review.</p>
            <p>We already have dozens of gamers editing the site but we could always benefit from <span>YOUR</span> help.</p>
            <h3>How to reach us</h3>
            <p>We are always available at our company e-mail address: <a href = "mailto: support@penta-news.com">support@pentanews.com</a> where you can ask any question about the site, suggest changes or apply to become an admin and write articles for us!</p>
