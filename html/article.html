                <h2>HYDRA vs IVY</h2>
                <p>Hail HYDRA! This unsuspecting team might not seem like a formidable squad, but they consist of familiar Kyrgyz players. Namely, Bakyt &#8220;<strong>Zayac</strong>&#8221; Emilzhanov, Kiyalbek &#8220;<strong>dream</strong>&#8221; Tayirov, and Evgenii &#8220;<strong>Blizzy</strong>&#8221; Ri, these players once had phenomenal debuts in powerhouse orgs.</p>
                <p>Like many rising prodigies in the EEU, they eventually become free agents after orgs disbanded full rosters for new ones. Hence, HYDRA is formed, a temporary group of well-known pros kickstarting their entry into relevancy. Jokes aside, HYDRA is a strong team on paper and has a good sense of late-game investment. They often pick reliable late-game carries, such as Slark, <a href="https://www.esports.net/wiki/guides/juggernaut-dota-2-meta/">Juggernaut</a> and Morphling, that aren’t very popular in EEU.</p>
                <p>Up against IVY, a qualifier candidate, Hydra certainly stands out as the stronger team. The only viable bet is to go for Under 32.5 minutes for <strong>x2.16</strong> in return.</p>
                
                <h2>Dota 2 Champions League 2021 Season 6 Match Schedules</h2>
                <p>All featured Dota 2 Champions League 2021 Season 6 match schedules are in CET timezone:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hydra vs IVY</strong> – December 13, 13:00</li>
                    <li><strong>Fantastic Five vs Nemiga</strong> – December 13, 10:00</li>
                    <li><strong>CIS Rejects vs V Gaming</strong> – December 14, 16:00</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Fantastic Five vs Nemiga Gaming</h2>
                <p>A more familiar mainstay in the semi-pro EEU scene is Nemiga Gaming. They aren’t shabby for a team that consistently competes in the Division 2 <a href="https://www.esports.net/wiki/tournament/dota-pro-circuit/">DPC 2021-22</a>. Furthermore, they are up against Fantastic Five, which doesn’t pose much of a challenge, compared to the other notable teams, like CIS Rejects, Brame, or even HYDRA. Gameplay aside, Nemiga has incredible drafting strategies, as we saw them deliver offensive initiations.</p>
                <p>They thrive in fast-paced games, where they pick off individual enemy heroes. At some point, their opponents are forced to play defensively due to how effective Nemiga could get rid of a hero. Expect the odds to favor Nemiga at <strong>x1.34</strong> versus F5 at <strong>x3.14</strong> returns.</p>

                <h2>CIS Rejects vs V Gaming</h2>
                <p>The latest addition to the EEU scene, CIS Rejects unironically screams the namesake for this line-up. Once major-winning players for Virtus.pro and more recently Natus Vincere, CIS Rejects are surely a temporary group for these players to play some Dota 2 games. The roster features three former Navi players, Roman &#8220;<strong>RAMZES666</strong>&#8221; Kushnarev, Pavel &#8220;<strong>9pasha</strong>&#8221; Khvastunov, and Vladimir &#8220;<strong>RodjER</strong>&#8221; Nikogosian. Unfortunately, despite the expectations for the iconic CIS players, the former allies didn’t deliver during the TI10 qualifiers.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, these rejects are still acceptable in terms of performance at the Dota 2 Champions League 2021 Season 6. Especially against V Gaming, which will most likely be at a disadvantage against RAMZES666’s individual skill alone. Couple that with his close teammates and the highly-regarded Artsiom &#8220;<strong>fng</strong>&#8221; Barshak.</p>
                <p>It’s a candidate to root for winning the Dota 2 Champions League 2021 Season 6 altogether. <a href="https://www.esports.net/betting/dota-2-odds/">Dota 2 odds</a>-wise, the CIS Rejects are expected to win at <strong>x1.51</strong> against V Gaming at <strong>x2.48</strong> odds.</p>

                <p>If you think the group stage matches are looking packed, stay tuned for the playoffs at Dota 2 Champions League 2021 Season 6. There are supposedly four invited Playoffs invitees, including HellRaisers and Entity, while the remaining two are yet to be announced. Even so, HellRaisers’ confirmed appearance is arguably the biggest threat for these teams. After they swept the floor against Virtus.pro, they became the next big thing in <a href="https://www.esports.net/betting/dota-2/">Dota 2 betting</a>.</p>
